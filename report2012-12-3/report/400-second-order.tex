\section{Second-order schemes}
\label{sec:400}

Second-order scheme are achieved using the reconstruction process equipped with a limiting procedure
to ensure the stability of the solution. For two-dimensional domain, the generic scheme writes
$$
\phi_i^{n+1} = \phi_i^n - \Delta{t} \sum_{j \in \nu(i)} {|e_{ij}| \over |K_i|} 
F(\phi_{ij}^n, \phi_{ji}^n, n_{ij}) 
$$
where $\phi_{ij}^n$ and $\phi_{ji}^n$ represent more accurate representation of $\phi$ on both
side of the interface $e_{ij}$.\\
Unfortunately, the choice $(a_i,b_i)=(\widehat a_i,\widehat b_i)$ is only correct when dealing
with smooth solution but in the vicinity of a discontinuity, the Gibbs phenomena occurs
and generate spurious solutions. To this end a nonlinear procedure is mandatory to guarantee
the stability of the method. 
Two different strategies can be considered : a {\it a priori} strategy (MUSCL method)
where the limiting procedure is performed before the the update; or a {\it a posteriori} strategy 
(MOOD method) where a candidate solution is computed and modified to provide the stability.

For one-dimensional problem, the scheme is very similar and writes
$$
\phi_i^{n+1}=\phi_i^{n}-\frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x}\Big \{
F(\phi^{n,-}_{i+1/2},\phi^{n,+}_{i+1/2})-F(\phi^{n,-}_{i-1/2},\phi^{n,+}_{i-1/2} \Big \}
$$
where $\phi^{n,-}_{i+1/2}$ and $\phi^{n,+}_{i+1/2}$ represent more accurate approximations
on both side of interface $x_{i+1/2}$.
As mention in the previous section, high-order in time is guarantee with the RK2 scheme both for the
one- and the two-dimensional case.
