\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:900}

This report presented a summary of the work done on two second-order schemes. The first one, using a more classic \textit{a priori} approach, was based on a MUSCL scheme to limite the polynomial reconstruction. A later method, with the \textit{a posterior} MOOD scheme, focused on building an initial unlimited reconstruction, and iteratively reducing the polynomial degree of the problematic points that were later detected with that reconstruction.
