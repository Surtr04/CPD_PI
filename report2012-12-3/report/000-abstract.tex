\begin{abstract}
We  present an analysis of first- and second-order Finite Volume Methods implementations in a GPU using CUDA, 
involving two different limiting procedure: the {\it a priori} MUSCL technique and the {\it a posteriori} MOOD
method. 
The initial version, using a first-order scheme, is the building-block for two different implementations 
of a second order scheme. A presentation and analysis of the algorithms are proposed, with an emphasis on the ease 
of implementation, the numerical results accuracy, and its suitability for implementation on a massively 
parallel architecture. The goal is to weight the different results for all methods against the scalability 
of their parallelization.
