This document presents an analysis of two second order Finite Volume Methods implementations in a GPU using CUDA, based on FVL, or Finite Volume Library. The two versions are implemented using different methods, specifically the MODD scheme and the more commonly used MUSCL scheme. An analysis is done on the algorithms, not only on the ease of implementation, but also on the numerical results accuracy, which alsos includes a comparative analysis against a simpler first order method. The goal is to weight the different results for all methods against the scalability of their implementation on a massively parallel environment like CUDA.
