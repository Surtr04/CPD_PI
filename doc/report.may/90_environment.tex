\section{Environmental Setup}
\label{sec:environment}

Two different types of nodes from the SeARCH cluster\footnote{\url{http://search.di.uminho.pt}} were used for the measurements reported in this document.

The nodes of the first type, referred to in this document as SeARCH Group 101, possess two single-core processors (with Intel\textregistered Hyper-Threading Technology) at a clock frequency of 3.2 GHz and 2 GB of RAM (see \cref{tab:group101}) for further detail regarding the hardware).

The second type -- SeARCH Group Hex -- contains nodes which have two hexa-core processors (with Intel\textregistered Hyper-Threading Technology) and 12 to 48 GB of RAM (see \cref{tab:group601} for further details regarding this hardware).

The first group was used to perform tests using 6 fully reserved specific nodes\footnote{Some nodes in the SeARCH Group 101 showed odd behaviours. As such, the tests were limited to the six specially reserved nodes (21 to 26).}. As for the second group, the tests performed were limited to 2 non-specified nodes with a clock frequency of 2.66 GHz.
