Two different types of nodes from the SeARCH cluster\footnote{\url{http://search.di.uminho.pt}} were used for the required measurements.

The nodes of the first type, referred to in this document as SeARCH Group 101, possess two dual-core processors with a clock frequency of 3.2 GHz and 2 GB of RAM (see \cref{tab:group101}) for further detail regarding the hardware).

\todo[inline]{here}

The second type -- SeARCH Group Hex -- refers to the 601 nodes and the two aditional 611 nodes, each one having two hexa-core processors (with Intel\textregistered Hyper-Threading Technology) and 12 GB of RAM (48 GB for the 611 nodes) (see \cref{tab:group601} for further details regarding this hardware).

Both groups were used to perform tests using up to 6 nodes, and spawning one process per core, which means 4 processes per node on SeARCH Group 101, and 12 processes per core on SeARCH Group 601 (Hyper-Threading was avoided), with each test being performed with the nodes fully reserved
