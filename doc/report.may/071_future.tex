\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}

Based on the results obtained so far (see \cref{sec:summary}), and the fact that the CUDA implementation is a naive one performed at the very beginning of this project, the most promising results are the ones which can be obtained with an optimized version of this implementation.

As such, the next and final step of this project will focus on optimizing the initial CUDA version.
