\begin{abstract}
This document presents a distributed memory implementation and analysis of the \texttt{polu} program using MPI. The main problem of a this paradigm was partitioning the mesh, which was solved using a naive approach. The resulting implementation presents clear speedups in the computational steps, but the results indicate that it is communication-bound. It presents good scalability in processors with a high amount of cores. The best results achieved are close to those of previous phases of this project, but the CUDA implementation stands out as the most promising for the final stage.
