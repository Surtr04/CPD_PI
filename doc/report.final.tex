\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
\usepackage{algorithmic}
\usepackage{IEEEtran}

\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/

% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
\else
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}

% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/



% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.


% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.


% NOTE: PDF hyperlink and bookmark features are not required in IEEE
%       papers and their use requires extra complexity and work.

% One significant drawback of using hyperref under DVI output is that the
% LaTeX compiler cannot break URLs across lines or pages as can be done
% under pdfLaTeX's PDF output via the hyperref pdftex driver. This is
% probably the single most important capability distinction between the
% DVI and PDF output. Perhaps surprisingly, all the other PDF features
% (PDF bookmarks, thumbnails, etc.) can be preserved in
% .tex->.dvi->.ps->.pdf workflow if the respective packages/scripts are
% loaded/invoked with the correct driver options (dvips, etc.). 
% As most IEEE papers use URLs sparingly (mainly in the references), this
% may not be as big an issue as with other publications.
%
% That said, recently Vilar Camara Neto introduced his breakurl.sty
% package which permits hyperref to easily break URLs even in dvi
% mode. Note that breakurl, unlike most other packages, must be loaded
% AFTER hyperref. The latest version of breakurl and its documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/breakurl/
% breakurl.sty is not for use under pdflatex pdf mode. Versions 1.10 
% (September 23, 2005) and later are recommened to avoid bugs in earlier
% releases.
%
% The advanced features offer by hyperref.sty are not required for IEEE
% submission, so users should weigh these features against the added
% complexity of use. Users who wish to use hyperref *must* ensure that
% their hyperref version is 6.72u or later *and* IEEEtran.cls is version
% 1.6b or later.
% The package options above demonstrate how to enable PDF bookmarks
% (a type of table of contents viewable in Acrobat Reader) as well as
% PDF document information (title, subject, author and keywords) that is
% viewable in Acrobat reader's Document_Properties menu. PDF document
% information is also used extensively to automate the cataloging of PDF
% documents. The above set of options ensures that hyperlinks will not be
% colored in the text and thus will not be visible in the printed page,
% but will be active on "mouse over". USING COLORS OR OTHER HIGHLIGHTING
% OF HYPERLINKS CAN RESULT IN DOCUMENT REJECTION BY THE IEEE, especially if
% these appear on the "printed" page. IF IN DOUBT, ASK THE RELEVANT
% SUBMISSION EDITOR. You may need to add the option hypertexnames=false if
% you used duplicate equation numbers, etc., but this should not be needed
% in normal IEEE work.
% The latest version of hyperref and its documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/hyperref/




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

% affiliations. Use \IEEEcompsocthanksitem which works much like \item
% for each affiliation group. When not in compsoc mode,
% \IEEEcompsocitemizethanks becomes like \thanks and
% \IEEEcompsocthanksitem becomes a line break with idention. This
% facilitates dual compilation, although admittedly the differences in the
% desired content of \author between the different types of papers makes a
% one-size-fits-all approach a daunting prospect. For instance, compsoc 
% journal papers have the author affiliations above the "Manuscript
% received ..."  text while in non-compsoc journals this is reversed. Sigh.

% note the % following the last \IEEEmembership and also \thanks - 
% these prevent an unwanted space from occurring between the last author name
% and the end of the author line. i.e., if you had this:
% 
% \author{....lastname \thanks{...} \thanks{...} }
%                     ^------------^------------^----Do not want these spaces!
%
% a space would be appended to the last name and could cause every name on that
% line to be shifted left slightly. This is one of those "LaTeX things". For
% instance, "\textbf{A} \textbf{B}" will typeset as "A B" not "AB". To get
% "AB" then you have to do: "\textbf{A}\textbf{B}"
% \thanks is no different in this regard, so shield the last } of each \thanks
% that ends a line with a % and do not let a space in before the next \thanks.
% Spaces after \IEEEmembership other than the last one are OK (and needed) as
% you are supposed to have spaces between the names. For what it is worth,
% this is a minor point as most people would not even notice if the said evil
% space somehow managed to creep in.

%\markboth{Journal of \LaTeX\ Class Files,~Vol.~6, No.~1, January~2007}%

% after the title page when using the twoside option.

% You can use \ifCLASSOPTIONpeerreview for conditional compilation here if

% The publisher's ID mark at the bottom of the page is less important with
% Computer Society journal papers as those publications place the marks
% outside of the main text columns and, therefore, unlike regular IEEE
% journals, the available text space is not reduced by their presence.
% If you want to put a publisher's ID mark on the page you can do it like
% this:
%\IEEEpubid{0000--0000/00\$00.00~\copyright~2007 IEEE}
% or like this to get the Computer Society new two part style.
%\IEEEpubid{\makebox[\columnwidth]{\hfill 0000--0000/00/\$00.00~\copyright~2007 IEEE}%
%\hspace{\columnsep}\makebox[\columnwidth]{Published by the IEEE Computer Society\hfill}}
% Remember, if you use this you must call \IEEEpubidadjcol in the second
% column for its text to clear the IEEEpubid mark (Computer Society jorunal
% papers don't need this extra clearance.)



% use for special paper notices
%\IEEEspecialpapernotice{(Invited Paper)}



% for Computer Society papers, we must declare the abstract and index terms
% PRIOR to the title within the \IEEEcompsoctitleabstractindextext IEEEtran
% command as these need to go into the title area created by \maketitle.
\IEEEcompsoctitleabstractindextext{%
\begin{abstract}
%\boldmath
The abstract goes here.
\end{abstract}
% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
% if the journal you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals frown on math
% in the abstract anyway. In particular, the Computer Society does
% not want either math or citations to appear in the abstract.

% Note that keywords are not normally used for peerreview papers.
\begin{IEEEkeywords}
%Computer Society, IEEEtran, journal, \LaTeX, paper, template.
\end{IEEEkeywords}}


% make the title area
\maketitle


% To allow for easy dual compilation without having to reenter the
% abstract/keywords data, the \IEEEcompsoctitleabstractindextext text will
% not be used in maketitle, but will appear (i.e., to be "transported")
% here as \IEEEdisplaynotcompsoctitleabstractindextext when compsoc mode
% is not selected <OR> if conference mode is selected - because compsoc
% conference papers position the abstract like regular (non-compsoc)
% papers do!
\IEEEdisplaynotcompsoctitleabstractindextext
% \IEEEdisplaynotcompsoctitleabstractindextext has no effect when using
% compsoc under a non-conference mode.


% For peer review papers, you can put extra information on the cover
% page as needed:
% \ifCLASSOPTIONpeerreview
% \begin{center} \bfseries EDICS Category: 3-BBND \end{center}
% \fi
%
% For peerreview papers, this IEEEtran command inserts a page break and
% creates the second title. It will be ignored for other modes.
\IEEEpeerreviewmaketitle



\section{Introduction}
% Computer Society journal papers do something a tad strange with the very
% first section heading (almost always called "Introduction"). They place it
% ABOVE the main text! IEEEtran.cls currently does not do this for you.
% However, You can achieve this effect by making LaTeX jump through some
% hoops via something like:
%
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \noindent\raisebox{2\baselineskip}[0pt][0pt]%
%  {\parbox{\columnwidth}{\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}%
%  \global\everypar=\everypar}}%
%  \vspace{-1\baselineskip}\vspace{-\parskip}\par
%\else
%  \section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}\par
%\fi
%
% Admittedly, this is a hack and may well be fragile, but seems to do the
% trick for me. Note the need to keep any \label that may be used right
% after \section in the above as the hack puts \section within a raised box.



% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps (small caps for compsoc).
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} demo file is intended to serve as a ``starter file''
for IEEE Computer Society journal papers produced under \LaTeX\ using
IEEEtran.cls version 1.7 and later.
% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% (should never be an issue)
I wish you the best of success.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.

% Note that IEEE typically puts floats only at the top, even when this
% results in a large percentage of a column being occupied by floats.
% However, the Computer Society has been known to put floats at the bottom.


% An example of a double column floating figure using two subfigures.
% (The subfig.sty package must be loaded for this to work.)
% The subfigure \label commands are set within each subfloat command, the
% \label for the overall figure must come after \caption.
% \hfil must be used as a separator to get equal spacing.
% The subfigure.sty package works much the same way, except \subfigure is
% used instead of \subfloat.
%

%\label{fig_second_case}}}
%\caption{Simulation results}
%\label{fig_sim}
%\end{figure*}
%
% Note that often IEEE papers with subfigures do not employ subfigure
% captions (using the optional argument to \subfloat), but instead will
% reference/describe all of them (a), (b), etc., within the main caption.


% An example of a floating table. Note that, for IEEE style tables, the 
% \caption command should come BEFORE the table. Table text will default to
% \footnotesize as IEEE normally uses this smaller font for tables.
% The \label must come after \caption as always.
%
%\begin{table}[!t]
%% increase table row spacing, adjust to taste
%\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.3}
% if using array.sty, it might be a good idea to tweak the value of
% \extrarowheight as needed to properly center the text within the cells
%\caption{An Example of a Table}
%\label{table_example}
%\centering
%% Some packages, such as MDW tools, offer better commands for making tables
%% than the plain LaTeX2e tabular which is used here.
%\begin{tabular}{|c||c|}
%\hline
%One & Two\\
%\hline
%Three & Four\\
%\hline
%\end{tabular}
%\end{table}


% Note that IEEE does not put floats in the very first column - or typically
% anywhere on the first page for that matter. Also, in-text middle ("here")
% positioning is not used. Most IEEE journals use top floats exclusively.
% However, Computer Society journals sometimes do use bottom floats - bear
% this in mind when choosing appropriate optional arguments for the
% figure/table environments.
% Note that, LaTeX2e, unlike IEEE journals, places footnotes above bottom
% floats. This can be corrected via the \fnbelowfloat command of the
% stfloats package.
