\subsubsection{AOS}

The first implemented alternative to AOP was the \textit{Arrays-Of-Structs} approach.
Instead of using pointers, structures were created for cells and edges, containing all the data related to each.
Where pointers previously existed to link an edge to the adjacent cells, or a cell to its edges, an index is placed.
While the dereferencing levels are completely eliminated, using indexes provides any element with identifiers which allows direct access to the other elements it needs to interact with, as long as all the data objects are stored in arrays.
The maximum representable index is used as the equivalent to \texttt{NULL} pointers (applied, for example, as the identifier for the ``right'' cell of a border edge).
