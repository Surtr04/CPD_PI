The main problem with this implemetation is data locality. While these issues are softened using a SOA approach, and the method is a first order one, the algorithm is still not very cache friendly in either of the core functions.

In \computeflux, each edge requires access to data from the two adjacent cells. While the access to edges is contiguous, access to cells is not for most of the iterations. Yet, border edges do not require the second edge.

\update on the other hand requires access to all the edges in a cell, which are always more than two. Analogously, the access to cells is contiguous, but the access to edges is not. Since each edge has more edges, than an edge has adjacent cells, and since no edge may be neglect for any cell, this function is most likely the bottleneck of the main loop.
