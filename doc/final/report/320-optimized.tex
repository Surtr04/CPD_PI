\subsection{Optimized}

\todo[inline]{Explain why arrays of pointers are bad}

The major optimization performed in the sequential implementation of \polu focused on the structures used. As previously stated, the original implementation relied on an AOP approach, but the excessively deep chains of pointers translate into more memory accesses, and consecutively worse performance.

The next two sections describe the two alternative approaches and explain how these can improve the application's performance.
