The application analyzed in this document, here called \polu, computes the spread of a material (e.g. a pollutant) in a bidimensional surface through the course of time. This surface is discretely represented as a mesh, composed mainly of edges and cells. The input is given in the form of XML files, passed as arguments:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Mesh description;
	\item Velocity vector for each cell;
	\item Initial pollution values of each cell.
\end{itemize}

Both the input and the output of the program can be converted to the \texttt{msh} format, compatible with the \texttt{gmsh} mesh generator, for data visualization. This is done using conversion programs, also written using the FVL library, which handle the conversion between the XML schema used by the library, and the mesh format specification of \texttt{gmsh} \cite{gmsh}.
