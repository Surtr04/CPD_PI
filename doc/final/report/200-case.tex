\todo[inline]{Explain what the program is meant for}

The application analyzed in this document computes, called here \texttt{polu}, computes the flux of a material (e.g. a pollutant) through a bidimensional surface. This surface is described as a mesh, composed mainly of edges and cells. The input is given by a 

The original \texttt{polu} application works like a heartbeat algorithm with no communication (since it is executed in a single computation node). The algorithm used by the application sees the environment as a discrete mesh (represented by its cells and edges) and loops until the specified time interval is reached. At each iteration of this main loop, the algorithm performs two main steps:

\begin{description}[\IEEEsetlabelwidth{Pollution Update}\IEEEusemathlabelsep]
	\item[Flux Computation] Based on current pollution values for each cell, the flux for each edge is calculated (performed by the \texttt{compute\_flux} function)
	\item[Pollution Update] Using the previously calculated flux values, the pollution for each cell is updated (performed by the \texttt{update} function)
\end{description}
