The application analyzed in this document computes, called here \texttt{polu}, computes the flux of a material (e.g. a pollutant) through a bidimensional surface. This surface is described as a mesh, composed mainly of edges and cells. \texttt{Polu} is implemented on top of a library called FVL (Finite Volume Library) which aims to provide classes to deal the general requirements of programs dealing with finite volume methods, like \texttt{polu}. Specifically, all the input and output and mesh data management is implemented by FVL. Part of the work to
