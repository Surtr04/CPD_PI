\todo[inline]{Explain what the program is meant for}

The application analyzed in this document, called here \polu, computes the flux of a material (e.g. a pollutant) through a bidimensional surface. This surface is described as a mesh, composed mainly of edges and cells. The input is given in the form of XML files, and in total consists of:

\begin{itemize}
	\item A file containing the mesh description;
	\item A file with each cell's velocity vector;
	\item A file with the initial pollution values of each cell.
\end{itemize}

Both the input and the output of the program can be converted to the \texttt{msh} format, compatible with the \texttt{gmsh} mesh generator, for data visualization. This is done using conversion programs, also written using the FVL library, which handle the conversion between the XML schema used by the library, and the mesh format specification of \texttt{gmsh}.
