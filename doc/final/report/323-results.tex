To evaluate the impact of the optimizations presented in \cref{sec:321,sec:322}, performance tests were performed with the original and optimized versions.
\Cref{sec:env,sec:method} describe the environmental setup and methodology for the tests performed, respectively.

\Cref{fig:seq:results} shows the results obtained for the three sequential versions.
Both optimized versions show a clear improvement just by not using the several dereference levels. Also, the results show a clear improvement by using SOA over AOS, proving the effectiveness of the optimization.
