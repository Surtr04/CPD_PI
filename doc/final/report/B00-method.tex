All the tests performed in this document were performed considering only the core functions of \polu's main loop.
Preprocessing stage and any cleanup operations were neglected, as their impact on the execution time significantly decreases as the time of simulation is extended.

Each test represents a total of 10 executions limited to 5000 iterations, where the final value is accepted to be the median, thus avoiding the influence of uncommon peak results.

This document shows only the results for the largest test case, which has a size of 62 MB.
While the generator used in this project (\texttt{gmsh}) is able to generate meshes with thiner granularity, thus increasing its computational load, the conversion tool provided with \polu is too complex to convert the generated mesh in usable time.

During the development of this project several tests were performed, with a special attention to some detailed measurements using the \texttt{PAPI}\footnote{\url{http://icl.cs.utk.edu/papi/}} library to use the available hardware counters.
Yet, in this final stage, such results are not shown and focus is given only to final speedups.
