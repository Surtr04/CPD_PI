	\begin{itemize}
		\item Sequential implementation:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[-] \textbf{\itshape Struct-Of-Arrays} is the best approach;
			\item[-] Limited by memory;
		\end{itemize}
		\item Shared Memory:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[-] Best results when not using Hyper-Threading;
			\item[-] Still does not scale very well (~40\%);
			\item[-] Limited by memory;
		\end{itemize}
		\item Distributed Memory:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[-] Best results using the 2 full nodes;
			\item[-] Less processes are hurt by large partitions;
			\item[-] More processes are hurt by lack of hardware support;
			\item[-] Also does not scale very well;
			\item[-] Limited by memory;
		\end{itemize}
		\item GPU:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[-] Best results of all implementations;
			\item[-] Limited mostly by the bad locality of the mesh;
		\end{itemize}
