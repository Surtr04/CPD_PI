\section{Polynomial Reconstruction}
\label{sec:300}

The first step towards a second order scheme was to implement linear reconstruction of the mesh. For this reconstruction, we seek a polynomial function of degree 1 that minimizes the function $E(\hat{u})_i$, given by:

$$E(\hat{u})_i = \sum_{j \in \underline{v}(i)} [\hat{u}_i(B_j) - u_i]^2 $$

where $\hat{u}$ is the approximation of $u$ on the cell $i$.

To achieve this, the approximation $\hat{u}$ can be given by the equation:

$$ \hat{u}_i(x) = u_i + \left( \begin{array}{c}a_i \\ b_i \end{array}\right) (B_ix)$$
