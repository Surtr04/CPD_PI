\begin{abstract}
This document presents an analysis of first and second order Finite Volume Methods implementations in a GPU using CUDA, based on the Finite Volume Library (FVL). The initial version, using a first order scheme, is the basis for two different implementations of a second order scheme, each using different methods, the first one employing an \textit{a priori} method for the limitation process, and another one usign an \textit{a posteriori} approach. An analysis is done on the algorithms, with an emphasys on the ease of implementation, the numerical results accuracy, and its suitability for implementation on a massively parallel architecture. The goal is to weight the different results for all methods against the scalability of their parallelization.
