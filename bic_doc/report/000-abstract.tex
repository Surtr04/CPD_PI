This document presents an analysis of first and second order Finite Volume Methods implementations in a GPU using CUDA, based on the Finite Volume Library (FVL). The initial version, using a first order scheme, is the basis for two different implementations of a second order scheme, each using different methods, specifically the MODD scheme and the more commonly used MUSCL scheme. An analysis is done on the algorithms, not only on the ease of implementation, but also on the numerical results accuracy. The goal is to weight the different results for all methods against the scalability of their implementation on a massively parallel environment like CUDA.
