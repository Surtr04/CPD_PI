\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Contextualization}
The Finite Volumes Method (FVM) is one of the three classical choices for solving PDEs\footnote{Partial Differential Equations: equations involving functions with more than one variable and their partial derivatives.} numerically, together with the Finite Difference Method (FDM) and the Finite Element Method (FEM).

The FDM is the oldest method and is based in the classical formal definition of a function's derivative in order to a parameter $x$ as the limit of that function's average rate as the difference between the two points tends towards zero ($\Delta x \rightarrow 0$).

$${\left . u_{x} \right |}_{i} = u_{x} \left ( x_{i} \right ) = \lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0}{\frac{u \left ( x_{i} + \Delta x \right ) - u \left ( x_{i} \right )}{\Delta x}}$$

Even if $\Delta x$ is not constant throughout the mesh, this forces the need for it to be structured on the FDM. The FEM and FVM overcome this by discretizing based on the integral form of the governing equations, therefore being able to handle complex geometries in multi-dimensional problems.
