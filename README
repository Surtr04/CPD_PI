### fvlib folder
#########################
each folder with the "fv_" prefix has a version of the FVLib library. The following versions exist at time of this README:

	default - raw project, with no changes to any code/makefile/etc
		Should match the zip versions provided at the beginning
		No write access

	# TODO
	def_tuned - changes to makefile/compilation process.
		1. Makefiles tuned to allow better control
		2. Small code patches to conform with -Wall flag (no structural changes to the code, only things like casting size_t to double)
		No write access

data folder has all input/output
	by default it is excluded from git. Only data/default_input is added, but only has read access and has the default input files provided
	manually add sub-folders to git when necessary (watch out for size)

# TODO
added a script to handle all the runs.
	Receives the name of the library version to use "fv_default" for example, and stores all output in a matching folder (data/fv_default)
